*** Prepare generated datasets for multiple parties ***
1. Generated_Datasets: 
    - All of them have personal identifiable features (house number, zip code, date of birth and sex)
    - Except personal identifiers, all of them have 20 generated variables + one target variable
    - Datasets were generated by a linear model (all features have linear relation with target variable)
    - There are 5 different sizes of datasets (csv): 5000, 10000, 30000, 50000,  and 100000 records 

2. input.json: 
    - input the number of data partitions (data parties)
    - input the datasets you want to use

3. SplitDatasets.py
    - once you complete the input.json, go to the directory in the terminal and run:
    - "python SplitDataset.py" (I assume you have python 3.6 installed on the laptop)
